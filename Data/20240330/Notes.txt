Put pork shoulder into smoker around 9:30am with usual dryrub

spray bottle broke and never replaced so I drizzled apple juice onto meat twice times unknown but might be guesstamatable from probe #4 data

data shows that I wrapped at 4:38pm (sudden drop in temp when I pulled the probes out)

around 5pm cranked smoker to 250 Degrees F
